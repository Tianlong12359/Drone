Acceleration motor
I found that the motor can better protect the motor and increase the service life of the motor by adjusting the acceleration and PWM to better reduce the damage caused by the eccentricity of the motor.
But it does reduce the CPU's lifetime by adjusting the CPU's breakdown frequency to 10 milliseconds.
The fish, what I want, the bear's paw is also what I want; the two can't get both, and the fish and the bears are also taken.
