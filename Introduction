I found that the motor uses acceleration plus PWM to better reduce the eccentricity of the motor.ButBut it is to adjust the
breakdown frequency of the CPU to 10 milliseconds, which will reduce the life of the CPU but this can reduce the damage to the 
motor due to the eccentricity.
Fish, what I want, the bear's paw is also what I want; the two can't get both, and the fish and the bears are also taken.
